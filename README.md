# ☕️ Pret Coffee Subscription Analysis ☕️

Hey there! 👋

Welcome to **Mocha-Metrics** (Coffee-Subscription-Analysis), a fun project born out of our love (and slight obsession) with Pret’s coffee subscription! You know the deal – one subscription, up to 5 coffees per day, but only one every 30 minutes. Well, what happens when **5 coffee-loving friends** decide to share that single subscription? Chaos. ☕☕☕☕☕ (And a lot of caffeine.)

## What's This About? 🤔

So, to keep things from spiraling into utter madness – who got the last coffee, who's next, is it time yet? – we started logging each coffee purchase in a WhatsApp group. Nerdy, right? But it worked! Sort of. 😅 

Of course, I couldn't resist going deeper. To avoid clashes and discover trends in our coffee habits, I built this sweet little **dashboard**. It's loaded with charts and visualizations to help spot our coffee-buying patterns: 

- Coffee counts by **weekdays** 📅
- Peak coffee **times of the day** ⏰
- And much more!

## What’s Inside? 🎉

This project includes:

- A fully-hosted **webpage** with interactive charts.
- Data insights on when and how we use (and abuse) Pret's subscription.
- A fun way to track your coffee obsession!

## Why Did I Do This? 🤷‍♂️

Because sharing a coffee subscription is great... until it's not! With 5 of us running on caffeine, figuring out who can buy the next coffee without stepping on someone else’s coffee break was getting complicated. This project helped us:

1. **Reduce coffee conflicts** (because no one likes waiting for their next latte).
2. Find out when we’re all most likely to grab a coffee. Patterns are everywhere!

## How It Works ⚙️

- We logged every coffee purchase in a WhatsApp group.
- The dashboard collects this data and visualizes it for easy analysis.
- Charts reveal our group’s coffee-buying habits and trends.

## Technologies Used 💻

- **HTML/CSS/JS** for the frontend
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
- **Python** for data processing
- **Altair Vega Charts** for visualizations

Enjoy the coffee ride! ✌️

**Note**: Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. Pret has switched to dynamic QR codes, putting an end to subscription sharing. That means no more shared coffees, data dumps, or updated charts. This project now relies on historical data to illustrate how we used to make the most of the subscription.
